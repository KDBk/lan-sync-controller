## Serf command
serf agent -node=agent-one -bind=192.168.122.59 -event-handler lan_sync_controller/pysyncit/serf.py

## LAN sync command

sudo python main.py start

## Test:

serf event "name|filename|timestamp|serverip"

>> result:

filename timestamp name serverip
127.0.0.1 - - [21/Jun/2017 03:18:59] "POST / HTTP/1.1" 200 -

Two above lines print by event function in Server --> this mean the server has gotten the events that we broadcast via serf
