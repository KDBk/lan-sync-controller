## We implemented gossip algorithm now!
During integration Serf along with LAN sync, we really have it.

- Step1: Start serf on first node

```
/lan_sync_controller$ serf agent -node=agent-one -bind=<first node ip> -event-handler lan_sync_controller/pysyncit/serf.py
```

- Step2: Start serf on other nodes

```
/lan_sync_controller$ serf agent -node=<othername> -bind=<other-ip> -event-handler lan_sync_controller/pysyncit/serf.py
/lan_sync_controller$ serf join <first node ip>
```

Step3: Config LAN sync and start on all nodes:
```
/lan_sync_controller$ sudo python main.py start
```
This is quite of complicated steps and not easy to run it on real eviroment.
For next step, I will integrate them into one command and auto join serf cluster by using list SERVERS that LAN sync have detected.
